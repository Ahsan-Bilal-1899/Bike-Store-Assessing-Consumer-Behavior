## Introduction
This work is my part of the contribution to the overall group project of one of my recent graduate classes, Data Analytics in Business. In this I attempt to use the Bike Store dataset and identify relevant variables that will help dervie insights onto how consumers are behaving based on the company's bike sales. Once variables are identified, I will attempt to clean the data, perform data manipulation, perform EDA and summarize existing outlook based on visual charts. Finally, I will use some machine learning models to further my analysis.

## Research Questions: Consumer Perceptions and Brand Choices
* How do consumers respond to price changes within different brands during different seasons? 
* Are there seasonal trends in consumer preferences for specific brands within the same product category?
